# Advent of Code 2020
Trying to learn Rust by working through [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/). First time I've done an AoC.

## Input file naming

Files should be saved in `inputs\` folder, using a `dayX` format. Loading functions can then accept `dayX` as a format. e.g., `day4` will load `inputs\day4`.
